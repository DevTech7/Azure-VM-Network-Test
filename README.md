# Azure Virtual Machine Setup and Network Testing

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and the validation of its connectivity through Remote Desktop Protocol and network diagnostic commands such as ipconfig and ping.  

The goal is to showcase practical skills in setting up cloud infrastructure, configuring secure remote access, and confirming system functionality through network testing. This hands-on project highlights foundational cloud engineering and troubleshooting techniques relevant to IT and DevOps roles.

## Steps Demonstrated
1. Resource Group creation in Azure to organize project resources.  
2. Virtual Machine deployment of a Windows 10 VM in the Azure Portal with configuration of settings such as region, size, username, and password.  
3. Remote Desktop connection using RDP from the local machine and verification of login.  
4. Network configuration by opening Command Prompt inside the VM and running ipconfig.  
5. Connectivity test using ping 8.8.8.8 to confirm external internet connectivity.
