# Azure Virtual Machine Setup and Network Testing

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and the validation of its connectivity through Remote Desktop Protocol and network diagnostic commands such as ipconfig and ping.  

The goal is to showcase practical skills in setting up cloud infrastructure, configuring secure remote access, and confirming system functionality through network testing. This hands-on project highlights foundational cloud engineering and troubleshooting techniques relevant to IT and DevOps roles.
