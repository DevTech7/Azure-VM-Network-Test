# Azure Virtual Machine Deployment and Network Connectivity Test

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and the validation of its connectivity through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and network diagnostic commands such as `ipconfig` and `ping`.

The goal is to showcase practical skills in setting up cloud infrastructure, configuring secure remote access, and confirming system functionality through network testing. This hands-on project highlights foundational cloud engineering and troubleshooting techniques relevant to IT and DevOps roles.
